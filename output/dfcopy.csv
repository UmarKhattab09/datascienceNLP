1,"{\an8}{\i1}How did this happen?{\i0}
 Nezuko, don't die! Don't die on me!
 {\an8}I'm gonna save you no matter what!
 I won't let you die!
 I swear your big brother will save you no matter what!
 Tanjiro?
 Your face is covered in soot.
 Come over here.
 It's dangerous with all this snow. You don't have to go, you know.
 Well, I want everyone to eat their fill on New Year's,
 so I'm gonna sell as much charcoal as I can.
 Thank you.
 Big Bro!
 You're going to town again today?
 I'm going with you!
 Oh no, you're not.
 You know you can't walk fast like Tanjiro.
 Mom!
 You may not.
 Since he can't use the cart today,
 he won't be able to give you a ride when you're tired.
 Big Bro!
 I wanna go with you!
 I promise I'll help you!
 Thanks, Hanako.
 But you're staying home today.
 You, too, Shigeru. But I'll get you tons of goodies, okay?
 Really?
 Yeah.
 And Hanako, I'll read for you when I'm back.
 Okay!
 That's a good girl.
 Thank you so much, Tanjiro.
 Sure.
 Okay, I'll be heading out now.
 Takeo...
 Will you chop as much wood as you can?
 Sure, I'll do it, but...
 I was hoping we could do it together.
 There, there.
 What's with that all of a sudden?
 You're blushing, Take!
 Hey, you shut up!
 There, there.
 I said cut it out!
 Hurry back, okay?
 Be safe, okay?
 Big Brother!
 Hey, Nezuko.
 I was putting Rokuta down for a nap, or he'd make a scene when you leave.
 He misses Dad a lot after he passed away.
 And everyone follows you wherever you go.
 See you later!
 {\i1}We don't have an easy life,{\i0}
 {\i1}but we're happy.{\i0}
 {\i1}But life could change suddenly like the weather.{\i0}
 {\i1}It shifts and moves on.{\i0}
 {\i1}It's not like it always stays sunny,{\i0}
 {\i1}and it's not like it ever snows endlessly.{\i0}
 {\i1}And...{\i0}
 {\i1}whenever happiness is destroyed,{\i0}
 {\i1}there's always...{\i0}
 {\i1}the smell of blood.{\i0}
 Well now, Tanjiro!
 I can't believe you came down from the mountain on a day like this.
 You're such a hard worker!
 You might catch a cold, you know?
 This is nothing, really.
 Do you have enough charcoal?
 Hey, Tanjiro!
 {\an8}Can I have some charcoal?
 {\an8}Thanks for fixing my sliding doors the other day.
 {\an8}I'll need some charcoal, too!
 Tanjiro!
 Oh man, perfect timing!
 I've been accused of breaking this plate!
 Help me out, will you?
 Sniff it!
 I smell a cat.
 You see?
 Oh my, so it was a cat?
 I told you it wasn't me!
 Tanjiro!
 Can you give me a hand with this luggage?
 Jeez, it's late already.
 I'm glad they're sold out, though.
 Hey, Tanjiro!
 Are you gonna go back to the mountain?
 You'd better not. It's too dangerous.
 I've got a great sense of smell, so I'll be fine.
 I'll put you up for the night.
 Come on. Get back here.
 But...
 Don't argue! Come on!
 {\an8}Before the demons show up.
 Thanks for the meal!
 Hey, Granddad Saburo,
 what are demons like?
 Man-eating demons have always prowled the land once it gets dark.
 That's why you should never stroll around at night.
 If you're done eating, go to bed. You can set off for home at first light.
 These demons wouldn't come inside your house, would they?
 Yes, they'd come in.
 Then, everyone would get eaten up by the demons.
 That's why the demon hunters protect us by slaying them
 since way back when.
 Lights out now.
 Go to sleep.
 {\i1}Old man Saburo is all alone after losing his whole family.{\i0}
 {\i1}So, he must be lonely.{\i0}
 {\i1}I'll bring my brothers and sisters next time,{\i0}
 {\i1}and say, ""You don't have to be scared. There are no demons. You're safe.""{\i0}
 {\i1}But, come to think of it,{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}my grandma used to say the same thing when she was still alive.{\i0}
 You be careful now.
 Okay!
 {\i1}Whenever happiness is destroyed,{\i0}
 {\i1}there's always...{\i0}
 The smell of blood!
 Nezuko!
 {\an8}What happened? What's going on?
 What happened here?
 Mom...
 Mom...
 Hanako...
 Takeo...
 Shigeru...
 Nezuko...
 Rokuta...
 {\i1}Nezuko's the only one who's still warm!{\i0}
 {\i1}If I can get her to a doctor, she might survive!{\i0}
 {\i1}How did this happen?{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}Was it a bear?{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}Was it a bear that wasn't able to hibernate?{\i0}
 {\i1}I can't breathe!{\i0}
 {\i1}The air's so icy! My lungs hurt!{\i0}
 {\i1}Keep moving forward!{\i0}
 {\i1}Move your legs faster!{\i0}
 {\i1}We still have a long way to go before we reach town.{\i0}
 {\i1}Hurry!{\i0}
 {\i1}I won't let you die!{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}I'm gonna save you no matter what!{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}I swear your big brother will save you no matter what!{\i0}
 {\i1}Oh no!{\i0}
 {\i1}I was saved by the snow.{\i0}
 {\i1}I slipped because of the snow to begin with.{\i0}
 Nezuko?
 Nezuko, are you all right?
 You don't have to walk!
 I'll carry you to town, okay?
 Nezuko!
 {\i1}Sh-She's...{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}a demon!{\i0}
 {\i1}I just remembered what old man Saburo told me.{\i0}
 {\i1}Nezuko's a man-eating demon?{\i0}
 {\i1}No! Nezuko's a human ever since she was born!{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}However, she no longer has Nezuko's scent.{\i0}
 {\i1}But it wasn't Nezuko's doing!{\i0}
 {\i1}She was lying as if she was protecting Rokuta,{\i0}
 {\i1}and there was no blood on her mouth or hands.{\i0}
 {\i1}And there was one more...{\i0}
 {\i1}There was one more scent!{\i0}
 Sh-She just grew in size!
 {\an8}{\i1}And she's getting stronger and stronger!{\i0}
 {\i1}While I was sleeping carelessly at Saburo's house,{\i0}
 {\i1}they were murdered brutally like that!{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}I know it must've hurt.{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}You suffered, didn't you?{\i0}
 {\i1}I'm so sorry I couldn't save you.{\i0}
 {\i1}If only I could help Nezuko at least!{\i0}
 {\i1}But she's too strong for me to push her back!{\i0}
 {\an8}Nezuko!
 {\an8}Hang in there, Nezuko!
 {\an8}Don't give in!
 {\an8}You gotta hang in there!
 Don't turn into a demon!
 You gotta stay strong!
 Hang in there!
 Hang in there!
 {\i1}What the...{\i0}
 {\i1}Who's that?{\i0}
 DESTROY DEMONS
 {\an8}{\i1}A sword?{\i0}
 Why are you protecting it?
 She's my sister!
 She's my younger sister!
 Nezuko!
 You call that thing your sister?
 Nezuko!
 Don't move!
 My job is to slay demons.
 Needless to say, I'm going to decapitate your sister.
 Hold on!
 Nezuko hasn't killed anyone!
 Back at my house, there was another scent that I'd never smelled before!
 That's probably the one who killed my family!
 It wasn't Nezuko!
 I don't know why she turned into something like that, but...
 but still...
 It's quite simple.
 Because her wounds were exposed to demon blood, she turned into a demon.
 {\an8}That's how man-eating demons multiply.
 Nezuko would never eat humans!
 You gotta be kidding.
 Just now, you were about to be devoured.
 You're wrong!
 I'm sure she knows who I am!
 I won't let her hurt anyone!
 I'm going to turn Nezuko back into a human!
 I swear I'll heal her!
 She can't be healed.
 Once you become a demon, you can never go back to being a human.
 I'll find a way no matter what! So, please...
 So, please don't kill her!
 I'll hunt down the one who slaughtered my family!
 I'll make everything all right!
 Please!
 Please!
 {\an8}Don't do it!
 {\an8}{\i1}Don't take anyone else from me.{\i0}
 I'm begging you not to!
 Please!
 Don't kill my little sister!
 Please don't do it!
 I'm begging you...
 Don't ever give others a chance to murder you!
 Stop that pathetic groveling!
 If it was the least bit effective, your family wouldn't be dead!
 Can a weakling who can't take the initiative in such a situation heal his sister?!
 Hunt down the enemy?!
 Don't make me laugh!
 The weak have no rights or choices!
 Their only fate is to be relentlessly crushed by the strong!
 The demons might know how to cure your sister!
 But don't think that a demon would respect your will or wishes!
 Naturally, I have no respect for you, either!
 That's reality!
 Why did you throw yourself over your sister earlier?
 Was that your way of protecting her?
 Why didn't you swing your hatchet?
 Why did you show your back to me?
 All those blunders led to your sister's capture!
 I could've skewered her along with you!
 {\i1}Don't cry.{\i0}
 {\i1}Don't despair.{\i0}
 {\i1}Now's not the time for that.{\i0}
 {\i1}I know you're devastated.{\i0}
 {\i1}Your family was massacred, and your sister's become a demon.{\i0}
 {\i1}I know it's painful.{\i0}
 {\i1}I know you want to scream.{\i0}
 {\i1}I get it.{\i0}
 {\i1}If only I'd gotten here a half-day sooner,{\i0}
 {\i1}your family might not have ended up dead.{\i0}
 {\i1}But there's no way to turn back time.{\i0}
 {\i1}Feel the rage.{\i0}
 {\i1}The powerful, pure rage of not being able to forgive{\i0}
 {\i1}will become your unswerving drive to take action!{\i0}
 {\i1}With such a fragile resolve like yours,{\i0}
 {\i1}you can't protect your sister or heal her...{\i0}
 {\i1}or get revenge for your family!{\i0}
 No!
 Stop!
 {\i1}A straightforward attack driven solely by emotion...{\i0}
 You fool!
 {\an8}{\i1}Where's his hatchet?{\i0}
 {\i1}Just before he hid behind the tree,{\i0}
 {\i1}he hurled that rock toward me and, at the same time,{\i0}
 {\i1}tossed the hatchet in the air.{\i0}
 {\i1}He hid his hands as he pretended to attack{\i0}
 {\i1}so I wouldn't realize he was unarmed.{\i0}
 {\i1}He knew he couldn't beat me.{\i0}
 {\i1}He tried to bring me down after I struck him!{\i0}
 {\i1}This kid...{\i0}
 {\i1}Damn!{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}She'll devour him!{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}Nezuko...{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}It wasn't Nezuko!{\i0}
 {\i1}She'd never eat humans!{\i0}
 {\i1}Long ago,{\i0}
 {\i1}someone once said the same thing, only to be devoured by a demon.{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}When a demon is starving,{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}it will kill and devour even its own parents or siblings.{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}Because they're nutrient-rich.{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}I've seen it happen more times than I can count.{\i0}
 {\i1}This girl has been wounded,{\i0}
 {\i1}and she's expending energy to heal those injuries.{\i0}
 {\i1}She must've drained vast amounts of her strength as she transformed into a demon.{\i0}
 {\i1}That means she's severely starved at this moment, without a doubt.{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}She must've wanted to feast on a human right away, even if it's her own brother...{\i0}
 {\i1}Yet, she protected him instead,{\i0}
 {\i1}and she even intimidated me...{\i0}
 {\i1}I wonder...{\i0}
 {\i1}These siblings might be...{\i0}
 {\i1}different from others.{\i0}
 {\an8}I'm sorry to leave you behind, Tanjiro.
 {\an8}Take care of Nezuko for me, all right?
 You awake?
 Go see an old man named Sakonji Urokodaki who lives at the foot of Mt. Sagiri.
 Tell him that Giyu Tomioka sent you.
 She seems to be all right since it's cloudy now,
 but never let her be exposed to the sunlight, okay?
 Let's go.

2,"Would it be okay if I took that basket, straw and some bamboo?
 Sure, you're welcome to it,
 but that basket's full of holes.
 Yes. I'll pay you for it.
 No, that's all right. I mean, it's a basket with holes.
 Yes, I will pay you!
 No, it's all right. You can have the bamboo and straw for free, too.
 But I'm still paying you!
 I said it's okay! You're one stubborn kid!
 Please accept this, although it's just small change!
 Thank you very much!
 Ouch!
 Nezuko?
 Huh? Nezuko?
 She's gone!
 There she is.
 EPISODE 2: TRAINER SAKONJI UROKODAKI
 Nezuko...
 {\i1}She dug a hole?{\i0}
 {\i1}My kid sister's turned into a mole.{\i0}
 {\i1}And she's frowning!{\i0}
 {\i1}She must really want to avoid the sunlight.{\i0}
 Wait there for a second!
 Nezuko?
 Nezuko?
 Think you can fit inside this?
 I want to keep moving during the day, too.
 I'll carry you, okay?
 Can you fit?
 In here?
 Basket.
 {\an8}She kinda protrudes, huh?
 {\i1}I can't believe she grew up.{\i0}
 {\i1}Seems like yesterday that she was tiny.{\i0}
 Nezuko?
 Remember how you became big like an adult earlier?
 Do you think you can do the opposite? Get smaller?
 {\an8}Smaller, Nezuko!
 {\an8}Get smaller!
 Good job!
 That's a good girl, Nezuko!
 I'm impressed!
 Mt. Sagiri?
 If you want to go to Mt. Sagiri, you'll have to cross over that mountain, but...
 The sun's about to set. Are you really heading there with all that luggage?
 It's dangerous, you know.
 I'll be careful.
 Thank you very much.
 People have gone missing lately!
 Try not to lose your way!
 There's a temple over there.
 There's light leaking through, so someone must be there.
 Let's check it out.
 I smell blood!
 {\an8}This mountain path is pretty rough! Someone must've gotten hurt!
 Are you all right?
 What the hell?
 This is my turf.
 If you break into my territory,
 I'll make you pay!
 {\i1}It's a man-eating demon!{\i0}
 There's something off about you.
 Are you both humans?
 A hatchet, huh? Not bad.
 But a scratch like this...
 should heal in no time.
 See that? The bleeding's stopped already.
 {\i1}He's so fast! And he's unbelievably strong!{\i0}
 You won't get me twice!
 All right.
 I'm gonna snap your neck!
 {\i1}Sh-She killed him!{\i0}
 {\i1}Oh, but wait! He's a demon, so...{\i0}
 N-Nezuko...
 {\i1}I don't believe this!{\i0}
 {\i1}Did he just move without his head?!{\i0}
 You bastards!
 One of you is a demon after all? You gave off such a weird vibe!
 What's a human and a demon doing teaming up?
 {\i1}He's actually talking!{\i0}
 Stop it!
 Nezuko!
 Nezuko!
 {\i1}What's the deal with this guy?{\i0}
 {\i1}Growing arms from his head!{\i0}
 {\i1}I gotta save Nezuko!{\i0}
 Out of my way!
 {\i1}Hard as a rock!{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}That head of his...{\i0}
 {\i1}Like a rock!{\i0}
 Okay!
 I wrapped my hair around his hatchet to grab it, but it got tangled up! Dammit!
 Nezuko! Where are you?
 Nezuko!
 Stop it!
 DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
 DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
 {\i1}I wonder if there are tons of demons out there.{\i0}
 {\i1}This isn't the scent that was lingering in my house.{\i0}
 {\i1}That was a different demon...{\i0}
 {\i1}But...{\i0}
 {\i1}I gotta finish him off...{\i0}
 {\i1}or he'll attack more people!{\i0}
 {\i1}So...{\i0}
 {\i1}I gotta do it!{\i0}
 {\i1}Do it!{\i0}
 You can't finish him off with that.
 {\i1}A goblin mask!{\i0}
 {\i1}I didn't hear his footsteps!{\i0}
 H-How can I finish him off?
 Don't ask me!
 Can't you use your own head to figure that out?
 {\i1}If stabbing's no good,{\i0}
 {\i1}I'll have to crush his head!{\i0}
 {\i1}To crush his skull and smash it completely,{\i0}
 {\i1}I guess I'm going to have to pound him with this rock many times.{\i0}
 {\i1}I bet he's going to suffer.{\i0}
 {\i1}Isn't there anything I can use to kill him with one blow?{\i0}
 {\i1}This kid isn't going to cut it.{\i0}
 {\i1}He's too kind and can't make decisions.{\i0}
 {\i1}He's facing a demon, yet the scent of kindness remains.{\i0}
 {\i1}He has empathy for even a demon.{\i0}
 {\i1}Giyu...{\i0}
 {\i1}He's never going to make it.{\i0}
 {\i1}I blacked out.{\i0}
 {\i1}Is my body dead, then?{\i0}
 {\i1}I feel sick!{\i0}
 You bastard, I'll kill you! I swear I'll devour you!
 Get over here! Dammit!
 I can't go to you, so you come to me!
 {\an8}{\i1}I faltered too long. Now the sun's coming up!{\i0}
 Hey, are you listening, brat?
 Hey, come here, you!
 Are you listening, you brat?
 {\i1}He's gone with that much sunlight?!{\i0}
 {\i1}No wonder Nezuko shrinks from it!{\i0}
 Nezuko?
 Nezuko?
 Nezuko...
 O-Oh, that's right.
 Where's that man?
 {\i1}He buried the people who got killed.{\i0}
 Um...
 I'm Sakonji Urokodaki.
 I'm assuming you're the one Giyu Tomioka sent my way.
 Yes! My name is Tanjiro Kamado!
 My sister's name is Nezuko, and...
 Tanjiro...
 What will you do when your sister devours a human?
 Too slow!
 You're just too slow at making decisions!
 You failed to finish off that demon before daybreak!
 Do you know why you couldn't answer my question right away?
 It's because your resolve is too weak!
 There are two things to do if your sister devours a human.
 Kill your sister!
 And slit your own belly and die!
 That's what it means to travel with your sister who became a demon!
 But that must never happen no matter what. And you'd best not forget.
 Your sister, taking the life of an innocent person...
 That's the one thing that must never happen. Ever!
 Do you understand what I'm saying?
 Yes!
 All right, now I'm going to test you
 to see if you're fit to become a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.
 Carry your sister on your back and follow me!
 {\i1}He's so fast! Just how old is he anyway?{\i0}
 {\i1}And, like earlier,{\i0}
 {\i1}I'm not hearing any footsteps at all!{\i0}
 {\i1}Nezuko, I know it must be jarring, but please be patient!{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}Well, being patient is all that you've ever known.{\i0}
 {\i1}Nezuko...{\i0}
 {\i1}All your life...{\i0}
 {\i1}You're fixing your kimono again?{\i0}
 {\i1}I guess we'll have to buy you a new one.{\i0}
 {\i1}No, no, it's all right!{\i0}
 {\i1}This kimono's my favorite!{\i0}
 {\i1}I'd rather the younger kids got more food to fill them up!{\i0}
 {\i1}I swear I'll turn you back into a human!{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}I swear I'll buy you a beautiful kimono someday!{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}Everything that I couldn't do for the others...{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}I'll do it all for you!{\i0}
 N-Now, have I...
 passed the test?
 The test starts now.
 We're going to climb a mountain.
 I'll make sure to take care of your sister for you.
 I'm counting on you, sir.
 {\i1}I'm so exhausted.{\i0}
 {\i1}My legs are starting to buckle!{\i0}
 {\i1}I'm starting to feel dizzy, too.{\i0}
 Now, from here, go back down to the house at the foot of the mountain.
 This time, I'm not going to wait until daybreak!
 {\i1}Is that all?{\i0}
 {\i1}I see.{\i0}
 {\i1}He thinks I might get lost in this thick fog.{\i0}
 {\i1}I just have to get back by daybreak, right?{\i0}
 {\i1}That's easy!{\i0}
 {\i1}I've got a great sense of smell!{\i0}
 {\i1}I've already memorized Mr. Urokodaki's scent!{\i0}
 {\i1}Rocks?!{\i0}
 {\i1}A pitfall?{\i0}
 {\i1}I get it now.{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}So, there are traps all around!{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}That's the deal, huh?{\i0}
 {\i1}Uh-oh!{\i0}
 {\i1}Crap, crap, crap!{\i0}
 {\i1}If I keep walking into traps like this,{\i0}
 {\i1}I won't make it down the mountain by morning!{\i0}
 {\i1}And besides, this mountain...{\i0}
 {\i1}This mountain is...{\i0}
 {\i1}The air's thin here!{\i0}
 {\i1}It's way thinner here than on the mountain where I used to live!{\i0}
 {\i1}That's why I'm gasping for air like this and feel so dizzy!{\i0}
 {\i1}Will I make it back?{\i0}
 {\i1}I might pass out!{\i0}
 {\i1}No!{\i0}
 {\i1}I gotta make it back!{\i0}
 {\i1}Get your breathing under control...{\i0}
 {\i1}and sniff out each of those traps!{\i0}
 {\i1}Right! I've got it! I've got it!{\i0}
 {\i1}Traps set by human hands{\i0}
 {\an8}{\i1}have a slightly different smell after all!{\i0}
 {\i1}But that doesn't mean...{\i0}
 {\i1}I'm suddenly athletic enough{\i0}
 {\i1}to dodge every one of them!{\i0}
 {\i1}I'm gonna make it back no matter what!{\i0}
 {\i1}Nezuko!{\i0}
 I... have... returned.
 {\i1}Forgive my abruptness, Mr. Sakonji Urokodaki.{\i0}
 {\i1}I'm sending a boy your way who wants to become a Demon Slayer swordsman.{\i0}
 {\i1}He was brazen enough to attack me unarmed.{\i0}
 {\i1}His family was slaughtered by a demon,{\i0}
 {\i1}and the surviving younger sister has become one,{\i0}
 {\i1}but I have determined that she will not attack humans.{\i0}
 {\i1}I can sense something different about these two.{\i0}
 {\i1}Like yourself, the boy seems to have a keen sense of smell.{\i0}
 {\i1}Perhaps he'll find a way to break through and become your heir apparent.{\i0}
 {\i1}I am asking you to train him.{\i0}
 {\i1}I realize that this is a self-serving request,{\i0}
 {\i1}but please forgive me.{\i0}
 {\i1}I hope that you will take good care of yourself in your endeavors.{\i0}
 {\i1}Yours truly...{\i0}
 {\i1}Giyu Tomioka.{\i0}
 I accept you as my student,
 Tanjiro Kamado.
 {\an9}PREVIEW
 {\an7}RUSTLE RUSTLE
 The demon in the temple surprised us quite a bit, right?
 I never expected to see arms grow from his head.
 Now that I'm accepted by Mr. Urokodaki, I'll do my best!
 Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!
 Mr. Urokodaki with the goblin mask... Believe it or not, his age isâ€”
 Tanjiro!
 Yes?
 Which do you want for dinner? Nikujaga or oden?
 Huh? Well...
 Too slow to decide!
 I want oden!
